👋 Hello, there!
<br>
✨ I go to the gym in the mornings, enjoy going out or playing with friends, also including the coding part for fun and practice when out of class.
<br>
🎓 I am a high school graduate, currently in the process of graduating from Growdev, taking the Developer Web Full Stack course.
<br>
😁 I don't have professional experience yet, however, I'm on my way to it.
<br>
👨‍💻 HTML and CSS so far are my favorite languages.
<br>
📚 Currently I am giving continuity to HTML, entering the CSS content where we will see next contents.
